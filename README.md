# Flutter Animations

A project demonstrating different types of animations in Flutter. This project covers simple to complex animations and their use cases, providing a comprehensive guide to mastering animations in Flutter.

## Overview

Flutter provides a rich set of animation APIs to create visually appealing and interactive user interfaces. Animations in Flutter can be broadly categorized into two types: Implicit Animations and Explicit Animations.

- **Implicit Animations**: These are simple animations that are easy to implement. They automatically animate changes to a widget's properties over a set duration.
- **Explicit Animations**: These provide more control over the animation process, allowing you to define the animation's behavior and manage its lifecycle.
